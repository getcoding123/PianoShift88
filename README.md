This is a cypher that maps each letter in the alphabet to the first 26 natural notes on a keyboard.
The interface asks if you want to encode or decode words. If you type encode, it brings you to a function that encodes what you type in. 
If you type decode, it brings you to a function that decodes coded words
If you type anything else, it asks you to type a valid answer and makes you run the code again
After you are done encoding/decoding, the code quits.
